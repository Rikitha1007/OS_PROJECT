The fork system call is used in Unix-based operating systems to create a new process. 
The new process, known as the child process, is a duplicate of the parent process.
It inherits the parent's resources, such as file descriptors, but can execute independently.
fork returns a value of 0 to the child process and the child process's PID to the parent process.
