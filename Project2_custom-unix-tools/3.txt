Shared memory is a method of inter-process communication where multiple processes can access the same portion of memory.
It allows processes to exchange data without needing to go through the kernel, making it faster compared to other IPC methods.
Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores or mutexes are typically used to prevent race conditions when accessing shared memory.
